# fastgan_dronedata_synthesis

To implement StyleGAN2-ADA for data synthesis, follow these steps:

1. **Visit the Official fastgan GitHub Page**:

   Go to the [official StyleGAN2-ADA GitHub page](https://github.com/NVlabs/fastgan) and carefully read through the documentation to familiarize yourself with the tool.

2. **Clone the Repository**:

   Clone the StyleGAN2-ADA repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/NVlabs/fastgan.git


3. **Create a Conda Environment**:

Create a Conda environment to manage dependencies:
conda create --name stylegan2-ada python=3.8
conda activate stylegan2-ada



4. **Install Required Packages**:

Read the requirements section in the repository carefully and install the necessary packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt



5. **Prepare Your Data**:

Prepare the dataset you want to train your model on. Use the `dataset_tool.py` code provided in the repository to prepare the data.

Note: StyleGAN2-ADA requires square-shaped images, so ensure your data is appropriately formatted.

6. **Ensure Consistent File Extensions**:

Make sure file extensions in your dataset match what the training script expects. For example, if the script expects lowercase extensions (e.g., `.png`), ensure your dataset filenames are consistent.

7. **Choose Adequate Hardware**:

Training StyleGAN2-ADA models can be computationally intensive. Use a powerful GPU for faster training times.

8. **Train the Model**:

Run the training script, specifying the output directory, dataset path, and GPU count:
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1 python train.py --path /home/akbar/Downloads/Kiranfarm_15m_altitude/  --output_path ./output/ --cuda 1




Adjust the paths and parameters according to your setup.

9. **Generate Images**:

After training, use the trained model to generate new images:
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1 python eval.py --n_sample 1000 --start_iter 0 --end_iter 5

Replace `/path/to/trained_model.pkl` with the path to your trained model file.

10. **Compare Results**:

 Compare the generated images with your original dataset to evaluate the performance of the trained model.

By following these steps, you can implement StyleGAN2-ADA for data synthesis and generate new images based on your trained model.
